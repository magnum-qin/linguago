# LinguaGo Project Overview For AI

This is the high-signal briefing for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## One-Sentence Summary

LinguaGo is a Cloudflare-hosted Vue PWA for multilingual translation and dictionary lookup, with dictionary-first word lookup, provider/model switching, KV caching, and structured streaming translation.

## Current Architecture

- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vuetify + Tailwind CSS built by Vite.
- Frontend entry: `index.html` -> `src/main.ts` -> `src/App.vue`.
- Backend: Cloudflare Worker in `worker/index.ts`.
- Static hosting: Workers Assets from `dist/`.
- Cache/settings/rate limits: Cloudflare KV binding `CACHE`.
- Dictionary: Cloudflare D1 binding `DB`, plus optional Louis SQLite API through `DICTIONARY_API_URL` and `DICTIONARY_API_TOKEN`.
- Deployment: Wrangler via `npm run deploy`.

```

## Important Current Paths

- `src/components/TranslatorCard.vue`: input UI.
- `src/components/ResultCard.vue`: result tabs, dictionary/model badge, report action.
- `src/components/SettingsOverlay.vue`: provider/model settings and dictionary stats.
- `src/composables/useTranslation.ts`: streaming translation loop.
- `src/composables/useSettings.ts`: local settings, model defaults, language labels.
- `src/utils/api.js`: frontend API calls.
- `src/assets/tailwind.css`: app styling source.
- `public/sw.js`: PWA service worker.
- `worker/index.ts`: Worker route dispatch and translation orchestration.
- `worker/dictionary.ts`: D1/Louis/mock dictionary adapter stack.
- `worker/config.ts`: backend model catalog and cache version.

## Stale Historical Paths

The project used to be a plain frontend. These references are stale unless a migration task explicitly restores them:

- `public/index.html`
- `public/app.js`
- `public/styles.css`
- `src/index.ts`
- `src/styles.css`
- `npm run style:build`

If you see those in docs or scripts, update them to the Vue/Vite structure before relying on them.

## Runtime Flow

```text
Browser / installed PWA
  |
  | Vite assets + POST /api/*
  v
Cloudflare Worker
  |
  +-- KV cache/settings/rate-limit
  +-- D1 dictionary lookup
  +-- Louis dictionary API fallback
  +-- selected model provider
```

## API Routes

Implemented in `worker/index.ts`:

- `POST /api/translate`
- `POST /api/translate-stream`
- `POST /api/report-error`
- `GET /api/models`
- `GET/POST /api/settings`
- `GET /api/dictionary/stats`
- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /health`

Unknown routes are served through `env.ASSETS`.

## Translation Flow

```text
request
  |
  +-- normalize input and target language
  +-- rate-limit
  +-- select provider/model
  +-- check KV translation cache
  +-- if word-like: try dictionary adapters
  |     +-- D1
  |     +-- Louis SQLite API
  |     +-- mock JMDict test adapter
  +-- if dictionary miss: call model provider
  +-- parse and validate provider JSON
  +-- normalize frontend response
  +-- write KV cache
  +-- return final response
```

Streaming uses newline-delimited JSON events:

- `status`
- `partial_translation`
- `partial_explanation`
- `final`
- `done`
- `error`

Dictionary and cache hits can return only `status`, `final`, and `done`.

## Result Model

The normalized response includes:

```ts
{
  type: "word" | "sentence";
  detected_source_lang: string;
  target_lang: "en" | "zh" | "pt-BR" | "ja";
  original: string;
  translation: string;
  translations: Record<"en" | "zh" | "pt-BR" | "ja", {
    text: string;
    phonetic: string;
    audio_text: string;
  }>;
  provider: "dictionary" | "deepseek" | "gemini" | "dashscope" | "openrouter";
  model: string;
  cached: boolean;
}
```

Sentence responses also include `explanation` and language-keyed `explanations`.

Word responses also include `phonetic`, `audio_text`, `word_details`, `senses`, and `examples`.

## Current New/Old Mix Risks

- Documentation had many plain-frontend references after the Vue/Vite migration.
- `scripts/sw-cache-check.mjs` was still checking for removed `public/index.html`, `/app.js`, and `/styles.css`.
- `npm run check` needed Vue and JS API declaration files after the migration.
- `worker/dictionary.ts` now mixes D1, Louis SQLite API, and mock JMDict adapters; clarify production source-of-truth before deeper dictionary work.
- Many untracked root files are SQL dumps, logs, transfer archives, and scratch scripts. Review before staging anything.

## Cache Rules

- Worker translation cache version is `TRANSLATION_CACHE_VERSION` in `worker/config.ts`.
- Service worker shell cache name is `CACHE_NAME` in `public/sw.js`.
- `/api/*` must stay network-only in the service worker.
- Vite hashed `/assets/*` can be cache-first.
- Navigations should stay network-first with cached `index.html` fallback.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run dev:worker
npm run build
npm run check
npm run check:all
npm run deploy
```

PowerShell may block `npm.ps1`; use `npm.cmd run <script>` if needed.

## UI Constraints

Preserve these unless explicitly asked to redesign:

- Result tabs should keep stable layout.
- Loading and final results should not create avoidable card jumps.
- Settings overlay must stay above app content.
- Theme should apply before first paint via the head bootstrap script.
- Service worker must not cache API responses.
- Keep model defaults aligned between `worker/config.ts` and `src/composables/useSettings.ts`.

## Recommended AI Onboarding Prompt

```text
Read README.md, docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW_FOR_AI.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, and docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md. Summarize the current Vue/Vite frontend, Worker API, dictionary adapter stack, cache rules, and known migration cleanup items before editing files.
```
